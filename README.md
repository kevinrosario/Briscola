# Briscola-Client

Briscola is a web game developed for the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project also uses Bootstrap framework and jQuery library. This front-end connects to my [RESTful API](https://github.com/kevinrosario/Briscola-API) deployed in Heroku which manages most of the game logic. This is the [link](https://briscola-api.herokuapp.com/) for the deployed app in heroku but it won't work because I restricted the access of the app to my deployed client only.

## How to use it

The game can be played using this [link](https://kevinrosario.github.io/Briscola-Client/). Please don't sign-up using a real email and password!

## Development process

I invested around 50 hours in this project. The most important thing I did was to whiteboard my problems before trying to code a solution. That gave me a clear sight of what I wanted and what I needed before trying to solve the problem without any path to follow. I started this project creating a RESTful API and then finished creating this front end.

## Technologies used

## User-Stories

1. As a player, I want to choose a card from my hand and play it so that I can win.
2. As a player, I want to be able to see my stats and the amount of games that I've won so that I can presume it with my friends.
3. As a player, I want to be able to play against friends or the computer so the game gets challenging and amusing.
4. As a creator, I want people to enjoy my creation and have a great time playing something that might bring old memories back.


## Unsolved problems

1. I would like to add a multiplayer to the game in a future iteration.
2. The biggest problem I'm confronting at this moment is that I'm unable to make the cards   representation take a specific size.
